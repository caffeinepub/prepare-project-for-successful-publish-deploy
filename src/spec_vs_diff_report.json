  "summary": "Diff adds a React+TS+Tailwind mobile menu experience with header/footer, paged section navigation, circular images with veg/non-veg mark, badges, animations, and warm-neutral theming variables. However, some specified requirements are either not evidenced (full 7-section content) or not matched exactly (Google Fonts import and spicy 🌶️ badge), and there are a few unrequested additions (Internet Identity wiring, third-party link/copyright, extra theme color tokens).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Import exactly two complementary Google Fonts (serif for headings, sans-serif for body) and apply them consistently.",
      "reason": "CSS sets font-family to \"DM Sans\" and \"Cormorant Garamond\" but the diff does not show any actual Google Fonts import (e.g., @import url(...) in CSS or <link> in HTML). Without the import, the fonts may not load as specified.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Create 7 menu sections (Hot Beverages, Cold Beverages, Breakfast & Snacks, Street Food, Main Course, Breads, Desserts) as separate pages, each with ≥3–4 realistic Indian items with ₹30–₹400 pricing.",
      "reason": "The provided menu data file is truncated and only clearly shows the first 3 sections; there is no visible evidence in the diff summary that Street Food, Main Course, Breads, and Desserts exist and meet the item-count/pricing constraints.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/menu/menuData.ts (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Include a \"Spicy\" badge using a 🌶️ marker and spice-level indication where relevant.",
      "reason": "The spicy indicator uses a Flame icon and 'Mild/Medium/Hot' text, but does not show the required 🌶️ marker. Also, the spicy badge styling uses destructive (red) tokens rather than the specified spicy 🌶️ marker requirement.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/menu/ItemBadges.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Use exactly one accent color (#D97706) as the sole accent color across the UI (no competing accent colors).",
      "reason": "Theme tokens include multiple additional \"chart-*\" color variables and the spicy badge uses destructive (red) styling, which may introduce competing accent colors beyond the single saffron accent requirement.",

        "frontend/src/components/menu/ItemBadges.tsx"

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Veg indicator uses #16A34A; Non-veg indicator uses #DC2626 (small square with colored dot, top-left of image).",
      "reason": "The veg/non-veg mark uses Tailwind tokens 'bg-success'/'bg-destructive' (from CSS variables) rather than explicit #16A34A and #DC2626, so exact color compliance is not evidenced.",
